# About the Program

C# is a modern object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft and designed to be simple and easy to use. Since C# is a high level language, it reads somewhat closer to English. In addition, C# abstracts away (i.e. handles for you) most of the complex details of the machine (computer) so you can focus on programming instead of worrying about the little details many consider both tedious and difficult.

As fans of this language programming, we can enumerate the following big advantages:

• Easy to learn

• Easy to maintain

• Faster than dynamically typed languages

• 4th largest StackOverflow Community

• 7th largest Meetup Community

• Lots of career opportunities

Are you not convinced yet? We are inviting you to join our C# remote program: „From zero to hero” and start enjoying the fun of becoming a software developer. For around 12 weeks, we will guide you through 3 modules: starting with best practices of C# and extending it by developing a web application.
